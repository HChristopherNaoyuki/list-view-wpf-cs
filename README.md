# Basic Chat Application

## Overview

This application is a WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) chat interface designed to mimic the style of Instagram's chat feature. It allows users to send and receive messages in a visually appealing format, with customizable message bubbles and a user-friendly interface.

- **Dynamic Replies**: The application simulates a chat experience by generating replies based on user input.
- **Close Button**: A button to close the application.

## Technologies Used

- **C#**: The primary programming language for the application.
- **XAML**: Used for designing the user interface.
- **WPF**: Framework for building the desktop application.

## Code Structure

### XAML (MainWindow.xaml)

- **Window Definition**: The main window is defined with properties such as size, style, and background.

- **Layout**: The layout consists of a header, message display area, and input area.

### C# (MainWindow.xaml.cs)

- **Initialization**: The chat is initialized with some default messages.
- **Message Handling**: Methods to send messages, handle key events, and update the UI based on user input.
- **Converters**: Custom value converters to manage the appearance of message bubbles based on the sender.

## Converters

- **BoolToAlignmentConverter**: Converts a boolean value to a `HorizontalAlignment` for message alignment.
- **BoolToBubbleColorConverter**: Converts a boolean value to a `Brush` for the message bubble color.
- **BoolToTextColorConverter**: Converts a boolean value to a `Brush` for the text color inside the message bubble.
